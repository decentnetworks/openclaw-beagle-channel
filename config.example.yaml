# Example OpenClaw Configuration for Beagle Channel
#
# This file shows how to configure the Beagle/Elastos Carrier channel
# in your OpenClaw setup.
#
# Note: This is a YAML example. Actual configuration format may vary
# depending on your OpenClaw installation.

# Beagle Channel Configuration
channels:
  beagle:
    # Enable/disable the Beagle channel
    enabled: true
    
    # Directory where Carrier stores persistent data
    # This includes the node's identity, friend list, etc.
    dataDir: "./data/beagle"
    
    # Bootstrap nodes for connecting to the Carrier network
    # Leave empty to use defaults, or provide custom nodes
    # Format: JSON array of bootstrap node objects

# Alternative: Environment Variable Configuration
# 
# You can also configure the Beagle channel using environment variables:
#
# export BEAGLE_ENABLED=true
# export BEAGLE_DATA_DIR="./data/beagle"
# export BEAGLE_USER_NAME="My OpenClaw Agent"
# export BEAGLE_USER_DESC="Personal AI Assistant"
# export BEAGLE_BOOTSTRAP_NODES='[{"ipv4":"13.58.208.50","port":33445,"publicKey":"..."}]'

# Advanced Settings (for future implementation)
advanced:
  # Maximum message size in bytes
  maxMessageSize: 1024
  
  # Connection timeout in seconds
  connectionTimeout: 30
  
  # Enable debug logging
  debug: false
  
  # Retry settings
  retry:
    maxAttempts: 3
    backoffMs: 1000
